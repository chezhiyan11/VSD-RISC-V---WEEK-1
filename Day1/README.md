# Day 1 â€” RTL Design and Synthesis (Introduction)

## Objective
- Understand simulation flow with Icarus Verilog (iverilog).
- Write and simulate a 2:1 multiplexer.
- Learn the basics of Yosys synthesis.

## Open source Simulator iverilog
  RTL Desig is checked for aherence to the specification by simulating the design

### Design
Design is the actual Verilog code for set of Verilog codes which has the intended functionality to meet with the required specifications.

### Testbench
Testbench checks whether the Design obeys the required specifiaction of not by applying stimulus or test vector.

### iverilog based simulation flow
1. Iverilog simulates the design using a test bench, producing a Vcd file for GTKWave visualization.
2. Yosys handles logic synthesis, converting RTL to a Netlist, which Iverilog also verifies.
